# INSTRUCTIONS
## Create a new console application using an IDE of your choice (i.e., Visual Studio). The application should be capable of downloading a file, opening it, extracting data from inside and saving it back to a different file with different structure. All details are in the points below.

### 1. The application should go to this page:
   
### https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia

### 2. Parse this page in a way of your choice and find the URL under the ‘Latest release’ section and download the content of that. Keep in mind that this link is not static, it will change every time the source releases new data.

### 3. In the content of that second page search for URL for the downloadable ‘Table 1’ XLSX file. It’s in the 2nd part of the page quite near to the very bottom. Download this XLSX file and save it under ‘data.xlsx’ name. Store the file inside your project inside the folder called ‘Downloads’.
